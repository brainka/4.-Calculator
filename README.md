# 4.-Calculator

Here is my completed Calculator!

It currently performs basic functions, such as:
- Add 
- Subtract
- Multiply 
- Divide and
- Clearing the memory to restart the calculation sequence

Boy oh boy did this project really test my JavaScript knowledge...

This project has had a few iterations but I think I am happy with the final result (although I will still add more functionality at a later stage for those M+, M- and MR buttons).

I think it has been interesting to see what all the stages of this project looked like.

It began with:
- Trying to capture the input from the screen
- Saving the input somewhere
- Trying to recall it to add it to an operation
- Ensuring clicking on the operators does not continously evaluate the figure
- Fixing so that the '=' button correctly performs the last operation as well as the last digit selected
- Commenting out code late at night, only to find in the morning this should not have been done and spend the next 2 hours debugging the issue I was trying to solve the night prior 
- Applying clean coding principles (to the best of my ability to this point) and reducing the lines of code from 484 to 297!!
- Adding in slight media query so that I can test the calculator on my iPhone while I am out and about

All in all, this has really a great project to complete because it has boosted my confidence tremendously when facing any new project that will come my way.

:D
